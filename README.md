# Royal Robes

This is an early attempt to build 2.5D RPG game. Map is built with Tiled and converted to JSON. Object collision with map elements is not finished yet.
Player can move around and use spacebar to attack enemies that spawn north of the player. 
There is an NPC on the west south. He has only one feature - stops movement when player is close enough.
There is some basic UI with player level, nickname, health, avatar and player statistics.
Animations are made from srpites. By deafault the game opens in the debug mode.
